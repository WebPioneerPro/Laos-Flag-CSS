# Flag of Laos - CSS Representation

Welcome to the "Flag of Laos - CSS Representation" project! In this project, we've recreated the flag of Laos using HTML and CSS. This exercise demonstrates how to replicate the design and colors of the flag of Laos using CSS properties and selectors.

## Project Description

In the "Flag of Laos - CSS Representation" project, we've created a representation of the national flag of Laos. Here are some key details about the project:

- The flag consists of two horizontal stripes: a blue stripe at the top and a red stripe at the bottom.

- A white circle is positioned in the center of the flag, with the words "of Laos" inside it.

- The flag's dimensions match those of the real flag: 900px by 600px, with the circle having a diameter of 200px.

- CSS properties and selectors are used to achieve the flag's design and layout. No additional classes, IDs, or elements are added to the HTML.

Feel free to explore the CSS code in the HTML file to understand how the flag's design is achieved using CSS properties and selectors.
